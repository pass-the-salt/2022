# Slides

- **Template:** Pass the SALT does not provide nor require any kind of template.
- **Logo:** you can use our logo on your speaker deck. The correct source for it is in this [repository]( https://github.com/pass-the-salt/2022-communication/tree/main/logo/). 
- **Preferred file type:** we prefer to receive PDF files. You can also provide LibreOffice format if you preferred. Power-what? You are at Pass the SALT, please ;-)
- **IMPORTANT send us your speaker deck:** we will greatly appreciate if you can provide your slides before your talk or just after it. We try to provide them to all attendees (on-site and online ones) as soon as possible on our [archives site](https://archives.pass-the-salt.org/).

- **Recording:** your talk will be live streamed and recorded by our Ubicast friends.

# Workshop room
